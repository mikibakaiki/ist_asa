### 1st Project ###

This project is about using Djikstra's algorithm to sort some photographs by order in which they were taken. Each photograph is viewed as a vertex, and together, they form a graph. The objective is to sort this graph in [topological order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

**Grades:** 
* Code test and execution: 16 / 16;
* Code explanation, theorethical and practical analysis : 2 / 4;
* Total: 18 / 20;



### 2nd Project ###

This project is about generating a [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree). We used [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm). 

We had to decide which infrastructure a city should build - road or airport - in order to have all citys connected, with the minimum cost possible. If a city has an airport, it is connected to all others cities that also have airports (we create an extra vertex that we can call the vertex "SKY" and is shared by every city that has an airport). Otherwise, the cities must be connected with roads. If building a road or an airport generates the same cost, roads are prioritized.


**Grades:** 
* Code test and execution: 16 / 16;
* Code explanation, theorethical and practical analysis : 3.5 / 4;
* Total: 19.5 / 20;
