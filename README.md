# Repo for the course of Algorithm Analysis


**1st Project: C**<br />
<br />The 1st project was about using Djikstra's algorithm to sort some photographs by order in which they were taken.

<br />
**2nd Project: C**<br />
<br />The 2nd project was about generating a Minimal Spanning Tree, and we used Kruskal's Algorithm, to find minimal costs between citys and decide if building airports was cheaper than building roads between each city.
